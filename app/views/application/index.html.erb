	<h1>Mission</h1>
	<div id="aboutus">
	<p>We are a site devoted to bringing the public accurate information about their food based on science. All information is pulled from sources readily (or not-so-readily) available online and in academic journals.</p>
	<p>One of the main goals of this site is to address and dispel public chemophobia (fear of chemicals). We hope to do this with an introduction to chemical literacy. This means becoming familiar with what chemicals are and what their role is in our lives. </p> 
	<p>Finally, we also hope to address and relieve a deep-rooted fear and stigma of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). GMOs have been around since our earliest ancestors first started growing and domesticating crops. Today's GMOs are a beautiful sign of technological advancement, and we want to show you why... </p></div>
